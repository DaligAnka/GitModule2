   <p class="content"> Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                Only this and nothing more.” </p>

<p class="title2">H.P. Lovecraft </p> 
<p class="content"> Babels of blocks to the high heavens towering
    Flames of futility swirling below;
    Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flowering,
    Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow.
    
    Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers,
    Cobwebs of cable to nameless things spun;
    Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers
    Streams of live foetor that rots in the sun. </p>

<p class="content"> Once, during the drinking phase, Wendy had accused him of desiring his own destruction but not possessing the necessary moral fiber to support a full-blown deathwish. So he manufactured ways in which other people could do it, lopping a piece at a time off himself and their family. </p>
